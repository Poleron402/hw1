        There are many models that can be followed by organizations in order to achieve the desired efficiency from SDLC. 
        Each of the models that is described here follows a specific pattern. WHile some models are more popular than others, each boasts 
        its own strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>
    <div id="model_list">
        <ol>
            <li>Waterfall
                <ul>
                    <li>In Waterfall model, the items are arranged sequentially. This means that one phase of development cannot begin untill another one ends.</li>
                    <li>With waterfall model, each phase needs to produce an output at the end, so that next phae has something to work with. For example, 
                        design phase begins, the design team will need a solid plan from project managers and planners. Same way, testing cannot begin befire development is done.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One could already see where problems may arise with waterfall. While it used to be a popular model before, it would take months for software to ship. If discrepancies arise in one whase, it might take a long time to have those in charge of previous phases to review and update deliverables.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Iterative
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Iterative model is a progress from waterfall. Teams start working with minimum requirements, and continue to build up and improve from there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A problem with iterative approach is that it might be difficult to predict the difficulties and manage resources appropriately.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Spiral
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spiral model is a combination of waterfall and iterative approaches. Teams do iterative work, with deliverables in-between.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the changes are done often, it is easier to backtrack inconsistencies and adjust to changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nevertheless, spiral approach could be an overreach for smaller projects.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Agile
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Agile approach is rapidly becoming the most popular approach in software development. It is highly robust and feedback driven.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In agile teams, deliverables are produced in small batches, often and quickly. With such a robust model, teams can efficiently adjust to changes, and keep customers in the loop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heavy reliance on feedback could slow the development process down if customers decide to introduce changes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
