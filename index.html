    <p id="p_main">Software development often heavily depends on being part of a <br>large team of people working on the same product.
    Sometimes, it might be difficult to come to common terms and practices in order to minimize errors and boost quality 
    of the code written, and hence the software produced. Software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process that outlines
    which practices need to be followed in order to achieve the smooth sailing in development, and great results in production.
