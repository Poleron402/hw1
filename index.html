    <p id="p_main">Software development heavily depends on being part of a large team working on the same product.
    Hence, it often might be difficult to come to common terms and practices in order to minimize errors and boost quality 
    of the code written and software produced. Software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process that outlines
    which practices should to be followed in order to achieve the smooth sailing in build, and great results in production.
