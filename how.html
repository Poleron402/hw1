                <p class="summary">During the planning phase, the development team 
                    allocates tasks to appropriate departments, estimate resources 
                    such as time, as well as risks, and set up a schedule to try to adhere to.</p>

                <p class="summary">The design phase allows developers to 
                    lay out what's required of them and 
                    find the best development tools to meet those requirements.</p>

                    and more. This is done to make sure the finished product performs well under various conditions.

                <p class="summary"> In deployment phase, the team prepares the deployment environment for the product. Usually,
                    there might be two environments - production (the one customers will use) and build (the testing environment for
                     developers).

                <p class="summary">Products often need updates to be compatible with various modules and versions 
                    that were used in develop phase. Also, not all bugs can arise in development. This phase allows the company to ensure 
                    customer satisfaction and provide improved updates and documentations.
